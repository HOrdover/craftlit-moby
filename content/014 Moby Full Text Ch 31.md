## CHAPTER 31. [Queen Mab.](https://chopbard.libsyn.com/05-its-the-mercutio-show)[^1]

Next morning Stubb accosted[^2] Flask.

“Such a queer dream, King-Post,[^3] I never had. You know the old man’s ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid,[^4] and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask—you know how curious all dreams are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not a real leg, only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.[^5] The living member—that makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg now, but a cane—a whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a playful cudgelling—in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a base kick. Besides,’ thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the foot part—what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me, _there’s_ a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired[^6] old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round. ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid![^7] man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz![^8] But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. ‘What am I about?’ says I at last. ‘And what business is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do _you_ want a kick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout—what do you think, I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of [marlinspikes](https://youtu.be/s-vpMSa9KQ8?si=2pIZg3NaGkjjDmvm), with the points out. 
![[marlinspike knife|lower spikey bit is the marlinspike]]Says I, on second thoughts, ‘I guess I won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’ said he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.[^9] Seeing he wasn’t going to stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise Stubb,’ I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I, ‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye here,’ says he; ‘let’s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I—‘right _here_ it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he used his ivory leg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says he, ‘wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right good will? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It’s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made garter-knights[^10] of; but, be _your_ boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of.[^11] Remember what I say; _be_ kicked by him; account his kicks honors;[^12] and on no account kick back; for you can’t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’ With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?”

“I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”

“May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak quick to him,[^13] whatever he says. Halloa! What’s that he shouts? Hark!”

“Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts! 
If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!”

“What do you think of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of something queer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that, man? Look ye—there’s something special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask. Ahab has that that’s bloody on his mind.[^14] But, mum; he comes this way.”

## CHAPTER 32. Cetology. (sec. 1)

Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the Pequod’s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.

It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here essayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.

“No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology,” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.

“It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. * * * Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal” (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.

“Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.” “Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field strewn with thorns.” “All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.”

Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will show.

Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now reigneth!

There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.

Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or—in this place at least—to much of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.

But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.

First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate the whales from the fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnæus’s express edict, were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.

The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from the waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.

Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.

Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.

By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.

*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.

## Footnotes





Melville wasn’t just riffing on dreams, but drawing from deep literary and mythological roots. Here’s a breakdown of what scholars, critics, and literary contexts say about this allusion:

## Origins of Queen Mab
- In Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet (Act I, Scene 4), Mercutio’s iconic speech introduces Queen Mab as “the fairies’ midwife”, a tiny creature who brings dreams that reveal hidden desires—romantic, legal, even violent  .
- The character is rooted in English folklore, where Mab became a popular name for the fairy queen, often depicted as mischievous but generally benevolent  .
- Theories about the name’s origin include:  
	- An echo of the Irish goddess Medb (although scholars note little similarity between the two)  .
	- A pun on Welsh mab (“child” or “son”) or derived from Middle English Mabily, linked to Latin amabilis (“lovable”)  .
	- An ironic use of “queen” (paralleled by the term “quean,” a prostitute) to signal something impish or subversive  .

## Queen Mab in Moby-Dick
 (Chapter 31)
- The chapter title “Queen Mab” frames Stubb’s dream—where he is kicked by Ahab and loses his leg—as more than a quirky reverie. Though Mab doesn’t appear in the story, the chapter invokes the spirit of dream logic and subconscious messaging  .
- As one commentary puts it, Melville uses “the granter of subconscious desires” as a fitting metaphor for Stubb’s bizarre, surreal encounter with Ahab, which feels like both an insult and an honor  .
## Research and Critical Writing
- General glosses and literary guides (e.g., Chasing Flukes reading guide, plain gloss websites) identify the allusion but typically don’t venture deeply into the folklore itself  .
- Folklore blogs and mythology enthusiasts discuss Queen Mab’s evolution—from Shakespeare to broader literary use—without specific ties to Melville. For example, one blog notes her famous Shakespearean description and broader literary afterlife  .
## Summary Table

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Aspect|What’s Known|
|Literary Origin|Shakespeare’s Mercutio speech in Romeo and Juliet (Act I, Sc. 4)|
|Folkloric Roots|Possible links to Irish queen Medb, Welsh mab, or Middle English Mabily from amabilis; also linked to “quean” (a low-class woman)|
|Allusion in Moby-Dick|Chapter title evokes dream-messaging rather than literal appearance|
|Critical Interpretation|See glosses hinting at the metaphor but little deep scholarly unpacking within Melville studies|
## Suggested Next Steps

If you want to go deeper, here are pathways for richer insight:

1. Folklore & Mythology Research  

- Explore the origins of the Mab figure in Celtic and English folk studies (scholars like Gillian Edwards, Thomas Keightley, and others might be good starting points)  .

2. Melville-Specific Criticism  

- Look for academic articles focusing on symbolism and perception in Moby‑Dick. Literary journals on Melville might have essays interpreting Chapter 31 in the context of dream imagery or Shakespearean intertextuality.

3. Comparative Literary Analysis  

- Position Melville’s usage against Shelley’s Queen Mab (a philosophical poem, though not directly connected, reflects broader literary resonance). Reviewing sources on Shelley’s poem could yield thematic parallels  .

Would you like me to help identify scholarly articles or folk-lore sources you can access (like JSTOR or folklore archives), or maybe pull more detailed commentary from annotated editions of Moby-Dick?

- - - 

Ah, excellent idea! Ehren Ziegler (Chop Bard) has a rich mix of Shakespeare performance, textual analysis, and practical theatre sense — which makes him perfect for a Queen Mab conversation. If you’re interviewing him, I’d suggest structuring your questions around three threads: textual, theatrical, and cultural/afterlife. That way you let him range from Shakespeare to Melville to broader mythology.

## Here’s a framework with sample questions:

### 1. The Text in Romeo and Juliet

- Mercutio’s Speech as a Turning Point:  
	- “Mercutio launches into this dazzling, manic description of Queen Mab in Act I, Scene 4. From a performance standpoint, what is Mercutio doing here? Is he showing off, deflating Romeo’s romantic idealism, or letting us glimpse a darker worldview?”

- Tone and Performance Choices:  
	- “How do you approach the tonal shift — the way the speech starts whimsical and tiny (‘the fairies’ midwife’) but ends grotesque (‘pressing the maid’s lips and teaching her to bear’)? What’s that arc telling us about Mercutio’s character?”

- Dream Logic vs. Harsh Reality:  
    - “The speech is about dreams, but does it also function as social commentary? Mercutio skewers lovers, lawyers, soldiers. What does Shakespeare seem to be saying about desire, ambition, or fate here?”
  
### 2. Queen Mab in Myth, Folklore, and Literature

- Folkloric Roots:  
	- “What do we actually know about Queen Mab outside Shakespeare? Is she invented for this speech, or was Shakespeare drawing on older traditions of fairy lore?”

- Comparisons:  
    - “How is Queen Mab different from more familiar fairy queens like Titania? Why make Mab so small, so grotesque, so intrusive?”

-   *Shelley’s Queen Mab:  
    - “Percy Bysshe Shelley also used Queen Mab for his radical early poem — a dream vision critiquing society. Why do you think Mab, out of all fairies, became such a resonant figure for writers looking to unsettle or provoke?”

### 3. The Afterlife of Queen Mab — Including Moby-Dick

- Melville’s Chapter Title:  
    - “Melville titles Chapter 31 ‘Queen Mab.’ Stubb has a dream where Ahab kicks his leg off — both comic and unsettling. Do you see a link between Mercutio’s frenetic dream-vision and Stubb’s strange dream-world?”
    
- Dreams as Commentary:  
	- “In both Shakespeare and Melville, Queen Mab connects to dreams exposing hidden truths — desire in Romeo and Juliet, humiliation and hierarchy in Moby-Dick. Do you think Melville is invoking Mercutio deliberately, or using Mab more broadly as shorthand for the dream-world?”
    
- Theatricality of Mab:      
	- “Mercutio’s Queen Mab speech is famously performative. Do you think Stubb’s storytelling in Moby-Dick works in the same way — a kind of performance for Flask, undercutting or distracting from deeper anxieties?”

### 4. Broader Shakespeare & Culture Angles
- Fairy Queens and Gender:  
	- “Mab is described as a ‘midwife of dreams,’ almost a twisted maternal figure. How do you read the gender dynamics of Mab compared to, say, Titania or Prospero’s Ariel?”

-   Why Mab Lasts:  
    - “Four hundred years on, Queen Mab still captures imaginations. Why do you think this small, grotesque figure continues to haunt literature and performance?”

-   Your Performance Take:  
	- “When you’ve taught or directed this speech, what interpretations of Mab have been most exciting, unexpected, or moving for you?”
## Discussion Lines to Pursue

- How Mercutio’s speech foreshadows his fate — manic, imaginative, but destructive.
- Whether Queen Mab is comic relief or a philosophical key in Romeo and Juliet.
- The connection between dreams and violence — how the whimsical leads into war and tragedy.
- How audiences (Elizabethan vs. modern) might have understood fairy lore differently.
- How performers balance the comedy with the darkness.

[^1]: Queen Mab - recall I.iv.54 Romeo & Juliet, Mercutio’s speech about Romeo’s dreaming as having been visited by Queen Mab, the fairies midwife. So, here, we know right away that Stubb is going to talk about a dream.
[^2]: There is a reason Melville uses the word “accosted” - check out how long Stubb goes before you hear from Flask. 
[^3]: King-post refers to chapter _______ __ __
[^4]: I find this imagery to be particularly ***ahem*** weighty. I mean, first off, who the heck would think you could get anywhere kicking a pyramid—other than getting a sore toe. Further, the first pyramids that come to mind (for me at least) are the extremely ancient Egyptian Pyramids (Which were even ancient to Cleopatra! She lived closer to the invention of the iPhone than she did to the construction of the Great Pyramid after all.) and while Ahab doesn’t exactly feel “ancient” to me, he does feel…weighty. There’s gravitas. he’s an immovable object AND irresistable force. Finally, it’s just not worth it to get into a fight with a pyramid—it’s not going to change for you. ¯\_(ツ)/¯    Finally, the low dorsal fin of a sperm whale is sometimes described as “pyramidal” so *another* connection between Ahab and whales ([[Moby - Cross-chapter References|Ch 41]], “For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.”)
[^5]: Wow really? But maybe he’s thinking along the lines of “sticks and stones…” being B.S.. I don’t recall physical pain much, but I sure as hell remember cruel things that have been said to me.
[^6]: wiry and stick-uppy
[^7]: Um… apparently this is an oath, like Z’ounds = “God’s Wounds” but this one is for “God’s (eye)lid”.
[^8]: ”Such a ***physiognomy***!” Could refer to a person’s face, bearing, impression, visual, and even their *nature.*
[^9]: Old Crone sitting by a fireplace for warmth.
[^10]: Not really “slapped” by the Queen, but touched on the shoulder with the flat of a sword.
[^11]: I don’t know about you, but I’m absolutely getting “domestic abuse” vibes from this. Getting kicked by him isn’t an insult, it’s a gift that’s he’s even paying attenion to you!
[^12]: Also, not just DV, but the entitled way some powerful people comport themselves and therefore how others treat them—regardless of whether they’ve earned our respect or not.
[^13]: Don’t back-talk, resist his orders <—- THIS is important!
[^14]: Yikes.
