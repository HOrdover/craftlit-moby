# Emerson vs Melville: Transcendentalism and Skepticism

## 🌿 Emerson’s Core Ideas

**1. The Oversoul and Unity of Being**  
- In essays like *Nature* (1836) and *The Over-Soul* (1841), Emerson argues that every individual is *“part and parcel of God.”*
- He sees divinity as immanent, present in all things, especially within the human soul.
	- "Standing on the bare ground—my head bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into infinite space—all mean egotism vanishes. *I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all;* the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am **part or parcel of God**". (Nature)[^1]

That's a lovely—if kinda kooky—visual. A big transparent eyeball, seeing everything.

And that ties in to Moby Dick in interesting ways.
Calling our narrator, Ishmael tracks on several different levels and will probably find even more as we continue through the book. But right now Ishmael in the Bible was the invisible one. Use the son who left and went away for a long time and eventually comes back but only eventually right now where we're at in the book Ishmael has been gone for quite a few chapters. We've been reading the electrical presentations of what's been going on on board and even in the scene where everybody else in the crew was laughing and yukking it up, dancing around and then having to prepare for a storm in a hurry we didn't see Ishmael. We will see him in chapter 42 again. However, this idea of being a transparent eyeball and just something that sees you're not thinking about what you're saying you're not interpreting what you're saying you're just it's just the facts man it's just this is what I see in this big beautiful field of nature. 
In some ways, Ishmael is that transparent eyeball. He was there. He saw everything (mostly) and is now transmitting the story to us as best he can— as best as he remembers and we don't know how far away in time he's writing this. We know it's after the events on the Pequod, because he is definitely looking back and giving us what he thinks is the important information we need to understand the whole story— like anybody does when they tell the story of something that happened to them in the past.
But in Chapter 1, Melville brings up the myth of Narcissus—not ECHO and Narcissus, just Narc. 
In grad school I read Ovid's Metamorphoses and so those are the versions of the myths I recall most completely. In Ovid, Narcissus sees his extraordinary beauty refrlected off the water, back at himself and is so captivated, he pines away and eventually dies.  
That is NOT the version Melville has a call back to. In a chapter where Ishmael tells us that going to see is his alternative to the "pistol and ball" - suicide - he also uses the darker version of the Narc story.

- Go back to Narcissus - in Ovid he reaches into the water to capture himself and drowns. That kind of navel-gazing (Emersonian) leads to Ahab?
	- - **Which version has Narcissus falling into the water and drowning?**  
     A version of the myth, mentioned in passing by the 3rd-century AD philosopher Plotinus and by Eustathius (ad Hom. p. 266), describes **Narcissus reaching for his image, falling into the water, and drowning**.
	- **Which version (Ovid's pining away and dying or the reaches for image and drowns) is the oldest?**  
     The version where Narcissus **pines away and dies** by the water is the one described by Ovid in his _Metamorphoses_, written around 8 AD. This version is older than the specific "drowning" version that appears in Plotinus' _Enneads_ (3rd century AD).

SO If we're thinking about Melville and Emerson, but THAT is the version of the myth that Melville is gravitating towards, it makes Emerson seem kind of... trite?
 
**2. Nature as Mirror of the Soul**  
- Emerson claims that:
  > “Nature always wears the colors of the spirit.”  
- What one sees in nature is shaped by one’s inner spiritual condition.

Melville is reminding us that what one sees in nature can be a mirage—and persuing one can kill you. Like Narcissus
Like Ahab.

## ⚓ Melville’s Response: Reverence and Resistance

Melville admired Emerson’s intellect but resisted his optimism and idealism.  
He wrote in a letter that he *“loved Emerson”* but *“did not love him enough to follow him.”*  [Herman Melville](https://www.google.com/search?q=Herman+Melville&sca_esv=abeb4f522ce11e62&biw=994&bih=874&sxsrf=AE3TifN6jc1fRIe9pKGLQFZ3iQCM2numJA%3A1765825100552&ei=TFpAaZ-zIeen5NoPkPLfuQM&ved=2ahUKEwi5r4GHpMCRAxXZwvACHQN9IK8QgK4QegQIARAB&uact=5&oq=+did+Melville+say+something+about+not+vibrating+to+the+colors+of+Emerson%27s+rainbow%3F&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiUyBkaWQgTWVsdmlsbGUgc2F5IHNvbWV0aGluZyBhYm91dCBub3QgdmlicmF0aW5nIHRvIHRoZSBjb2xvcnMgb2YgRW1lcnNvbidzIHJhaW5ib3c_SABQAFgAcAB4AJABAJgBAKABAKoBALgBA8gBAPgBAZgCAKACAJgDAJIHAKAHALIHALgHAMIHAMgHAIAIAA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp&mstk=AUtExfD6AZSixpeoeQeD1D2prPRrN_HFrhgYO9vKMVE_N6oheDJUN7tT2ckU6YIW1ufzzjPPlU3UPpa-hkJ2lkBsxaUi9avsvJ36OkU5laN1g4AcYchPGFawyjafDzR5qwJSbYH3jwB--nGJVLaBGoFDNNFjECuNkyEuUv5EAo6s_av4q2hhCaRlVcN8ARIMxYBp1z8BTTa9Y90RCJ6VaGIOVpJNMiv0o0kVtlfAlZ13OGh9Eo1HJE7_fCfGmy45FKCAly4GgXSkn_FezjPfF6MQGxGrAKKO63-s8_pQLWPLpJ14xw&csui=3) famously wrote, "I do not oscillate in Emerson's rainbow, but prefer rather to hang myself in mine own halter than swing in any other man's swing," expressing his independent spirit and divergence from Emerson's transcendentalism, even while acknowledging Emerson's brilliance. This quote highlights Melville's rejection of simply following Emerson's optimistic, nature-focused worldview (the "rainbow") for his own darker, more complex path, as seen in works like _Moby Dick_. 
- **Context of the Quote**
	- **Source:** Melville wrote this in a letter to fellow writer Evert Duyckinck in the 1840s or 1850s, reflecting his evolving relationship with Emerson.

| Nature is a benevolent revelation of divine spirit. | Nature is ambiguous, opaque, even malevolent.        |

| Celebrates insight, perception, mystical oneness.   | *Emphasizes ambiguity, irony, and unknow*ability.    |
| Sees spiritual truths in outward forms.             | *Seeks to pierce illusions — doubts the visible.*    |

## 📘 In *Moby-Dick*

**Ahab as Anti-Transcendentalist**  
- Ahab **rejects Emerson’s optimism**. To him, the world is masked and deceptive:  
  > “All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks.”  (Ch 36, The Quarterdeck)
- His mission is to *pierce the mask* and confront whatever dark force lies behind reality — an anti-Emersonian quest.

**Ishmael as Ironic Mediator**  
- Early on, Ishmael displays Emersonian openness to the sublime (“a damp, drizzly November in my soul”), but he ultimately learns **humility**, **limit**, and **multiplicity**, not mystical unity.

**The Whiteness of the Whale (Chapter 42)**  
- Where Emerson might see purity or divinity in whiteness, Melville sees a *terrifying blankness*:  
  > “... the whiteness of the whale was even more frightful than the rest of him.”  
- A direct **philosophical inversion** of Transcendental idealism.

### Squaring the transcendental/Anti-transcendental thing
It's a  **productive tension** in _Moby-Dick_ criticism: Ahab can be read as **both a kind of transcendentalist** _and_ as an **anti-transcendentalist**, depending on how we define the term and what facet of his quest we’re emphasizing.

## **🔍 Ahab as Anti-Transcendentalist (Traditional View)**
### **Based on:**

- His **Chapter 36 “pasteboard mask” speech**
    - His **rage against appearances** and desire to _“strike through the mask”_
    - His **monomania** and **rejection of mystery**
    
### **Interpretation:**

- Ahab **rejects the Emersonian belief** that nature reveals spiritual truth.
    - Where Emerson sees the world as a reflection of the _Over-Soul_, Ahab sees a **lie**: the whale is not a symbol of God but a **veil hiding some malevolent force**.
    - His desire is not to **merge with** the universe but to **master or destroy** it.
    
> “If man will strike, strike through the mask!”

He believes there _is_ something behind the mask—but it may not be benevolent. That drive makes him **Promethean, Faustian**, and in the Emersonian framework, dangerously out of tune with the moral harmony of the universe.

---
## **🔍 Ahab as** **Failed** **Transcendentalist (from** **Literary Matters**, Issue 9.2)**

  ### **Based on:**

- A broader definition of Transcendentalism as **the drive toward absolute truth**
    - The notion that both Ahab and Ishmael are seeking **meaning beyond appearances**
    - The idea that both characters are ultimately **thwarted by the limits of human understanding**
    
### **Interpretation:**

- Ahab **shares** with Emerson a belief that the visible world points toward a deeper, spiritual truth — **he believes in hidden meaning**, and **he wants to uncover it**.
    - But his methods are violent, coercive, and self-aggrandizing — a **perversion of transcendental idealism**.
    - The whale becomes his **idol**, the embodiment of an unknowable truth, like Emerson’s Oversoul **made monstrous**.
    
In this view, **Ahab starts as a transcendentalist**, but **fails to live within its limits**. He overreaches, and his spiritual ambition becomes destructive.

---

## **🤝 Reconciliation: Ahab as a Dark Transcendentalist**

We can square the two readings by saying:

> Ahab **embodies the transcendental impulse** (to seek unity, to pierce appearances, to uncover the Real)

> — but he **corrupts it** with obsession, ego, and violence.

> Therefore, he becomes a kind of **anti-Emersonian transcendentalist** — one who seeks the _same goal_, but _by radically different, destructive means_.
  

This also echoes Melville’s deeper critique: the pursuit of divine meaning may not yield harmony and understanding — it may instead lead to **madness, solipsism, or annihilation**.

## 🖋️ Historical and Scholarly Notes

- Melville attended an Emerson lecture in 1849 (Boston).
- Letters to Hawthorne and Duyckinck show conflicted admiration.
- He may have seen Emerson as a man of *books and abstractions*, not of *whales and storms*:
  > *A man who talks of infinity with the air of a man who has never been to sea*. <--not a quote, but should have been ;) 

This disagreement — spiritual optimism vs cosmic doubt — becomes a defining tension in American literary thought.

## 🧠 TL;DR Summary

> **Emerson**: The world is spirit made visible — truth is there if you look.  
> **Melville**: If the world is spirit, it's not comforting — it’s vast, ambiguous, and potentially hostile.

# Footnotes

[^1]:  **🏛️ Origin:** - The phrase **“part and parcel”** dates back to the **14th century** and comes from **Anglo-Norman legal language**.  It combines **“part”** (a portion) with **“parcel”**, which originally meant a **small part or portion**, from Old French _parcelle_ (from Latin _particella_, a diminutive of _pars_, meaning “part”).
