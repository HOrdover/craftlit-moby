Here’s a list of some of the funniest chapters, with bullet-point notes on what makes each one hilarious:

  


• Chapter 2: “The Carpet-Bag”

• Ishmael’s awkward search for an inn on a cold, rainy night.

• He ends up in the Spouter-Inn, where things just get weirder.

• Chapter 3: “The Spouter-Inn”

• Comic descriptions of a bizarre, incomprehensible painting.

• Ishmael meets the fearsome Queequeg—but can’t understand his language or intentions.

• Builds to the hilarious and affectionate “marriage bed” moment between the two.

• Chapter 4: “The Counterpane”

• Ishmael wakes up with Queequeg’s arm draped over him “in the most loving and affectionate manner.”

• A tender yet absurd reflection on cultural difference and bodily intimacy.

• Chapter 10: “A Bosom Friend”

• Ishmael rhapsodizes about Queequeg with over-the-top, mock-romantic language.

• The chapter satirizes sentimental writing and bromantic excess.

• Chapter 17: “The Ramadan”

• Ishmael tries to get Queequeg to stop fasting and contorting himself in his religious ritual.

• His frustration and condescension become their own joke.

• Chapter 23: “The Lee Shore”

• A grandiose tribute to a minor character, Bulkington, whom we never really see again.

• The seriousness of tone for such a brief cameo is comically disproportionate.

• Chapter 33: “The Specksnyder”

• A long, deadpan explanation of the title and role of the “chief mate.”

• Part of Melville’s tendency to treat whale-hunting bureaucracy with mock-gravity.

• Chapter 55: “Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales”

• Ishmael rants about how badly whales are painted and engraved in books and art.

• He names and mocks specific (fictional) artists—satire of academic pretension and bad taste.

• Chapter 58: “Brit”

• Philosophical musing on tiny marine life eaten by whales, full of dry wit.

• Ends with comic contrast between the serene sea and the violence underneath.

• Chapter 65: “The Whale as a Dish”

• Ishmael defends the eating of whale meat with ridiculous logic.

• Lists historical whale-eaters, culminating in his “vindication” of the dish.

• Chapter 69: “The Funeral”

• A funeral for a whale carcass, described in mock-epic, overly reverent tone.

• The chapter is both disgusting and weirdly reverent—very Melville.

• Chapter 79: “The Prairie”

• A bizarre and humorous meditation on a whale’s forehead.

• Melville gets mock-philosophical about its “brow” and lack of eyebrows.

• Chapter 91: “The Pequod Meets the Rose-Bud”

• A French whaling ship is tricked by Stubb into giving up its stinking whale.

• Stubb is gleefully manipulative, and the French crew are played as comic foils.
