## “Plot-only” chapters of Moby-Dick

Herman Melville weaves digressions (whaling, philosophy, sermons, cetology) in between the forward-moving narrative. If you want just the story arc (Ahab, Ishmael, the Pequod, the whale), scholars and readers seem to agree the “plot” is largely in these chapters:

- 1–3: Ishmael’s introduction and meeting Queequeg.
    
- 6–22: Social world of New Bedford/Nantucket, the voyage preparations, signing on the Pequod.
    
- 28–47: Ahab introduced, the doubloon nailed to the mast, prophecy, crew oaths.
    
- 48–61: First lowering of whaleboats, encounter with other ships.
    
- 81–82, 87–88, 100–105: Major whale hunts, Stubb/Flask character moments, the “try-works.”
    
- 109, 113–119, 123, 127–135: The Fedallah prophecies, storm, final chase.  

That gives you about 40–45 chapters out of 135 where “something happens.” You’d skip most of the cetology (whale biology), philosophy, and long symbolic chapters.
