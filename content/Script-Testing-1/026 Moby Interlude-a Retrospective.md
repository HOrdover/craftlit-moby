## In the beginning
I didn't do Etymologies??!
So now I have [[🎤000-MOBY START]]

Now that we're a bit more than 30% of the way through Moby Dick I wanted to take a moment to flip back to pick up what Melville was laying down over these last 41 chapters. I have a feeling we'll be doing this at least one more time.

Early on—in Chapter 1, I think—I brought up Walt Whitman. I want to add to the Walt Whitman connection. 
In 1849 Hermann Melville got a chance to listen to Emerson give a talk. Ralph Waldo Emerson was the progenitor of the transcendentalist movement in New England: very proto-hippie, positive, upbeat, expansive, uniting, we are the children of God—kind of joyful love of the world and everything in it. 
It might not surprise you that Hermann Melville was impressed by, and enjoyed, Emerson's philosophy and poetry, but he also wrote in a letter to an editor friend of his, *"I do not oscillate in Emerson's rainbow, but prefer rather to hang myself in mine own halter than swing in any other man's swing,"* expressing his independent spirit and divergence from Emerson's transcendentalism, even while acknowledging Emerson's brilliance.
You can probably tell why I think it's important that we take a moment to talk about Melville and the transcendentalists, and the anti-transcendentalists. 
I think I mentioned early on that when I was teaching American literature,  I remembered reading in the textbook some note saying that Melville was part of the "anti-transcendentalists" and I think that —when I brought that up—we were reading some of the funnier chapters of Moby Dick and I said something smart like, "well, that just proves that the textbook didn't know what it was talking about." 
But now that we've read more, I think it's getting more and more important for us to be able to position Hermann Melville in his time and in the company he kept. To do that, I think I need to give you a quick and dirty explanation of Emerson and what he believed.

### [[🎤001 Moby Full Text Ch01 Loomings]]
- **Summary:** 
- etymology and extracts: 
	- Having these sections at the start of a book is NOT odd.
	- However, HOW he presents these two items IS VERY ODD.
		- this gives us a heads up *This is gonna be a weird book*. The first part on the WORD WHALE  is compiled by "Usher" and he tells us that the book will be about words and whales EVERY LANGUAGE (sort of) he brings up
			- ===The pale Usher—threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the world. ***He loved to dust his old grammars; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.***===
- THEN there's the Sub Sub librarian, NUTCASE has been searching for whales in all the words  and ALL the places—There's a joke in the intro to the Extracts "give it up, SubSub" 
	- ===It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology[^7]. Far from it. As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.          *So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry[^8] would be too rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish[^36], too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness—Give it up, Sub-Subs!* ===
		- we start with holy scripture 
		- we see whales in every discipline science Shakespeare newspaper, proving that whales are ubiquitous they are present everywhere in all disciplines 
		- Genisys whales both in the beginning whales are forever 
		- see I can science too, HOWEVER, if you're looking for science/reality/truth here give up now 
	- 
	- 
	- 1851 Race problems are looming - fates looming something is coming 
	- 1851 uncle Tom's cabin  and fugitive slave law. 
	- **MELVILLE WROTE:** *I am writing the scripture of the age. I am writing a wicked book.*

It's also important to recall the impact the Complete Works of Shakespeare (large print edition) had on Millville. I think the love that he has for the theater comes across and the parallel that we get out of the theatrical side of things that I find interesting is he came from a fairly strict fatalistic religion. God has determined therefore your faith is fixed in place you have stage managers you have a script. The end is known you are fulfilling your role you're playing part in a story that you were not given an opportunity to write. You don't get editorial options when you're in a plane.

The other thing about the theatrical bit and starting with the etymology and as extracts that I think is super important is if you remember before this book was written, there were  **Epistolary** novels that were very popular and we on craftlit have seen two that were very well done. When was the woman in White by Wilkie collins also written 1850 and one was Dracula Graham Stoker Dracula from 1890. I think the important thing to consider here is that many many many books had that kind of Found document vibe to them and many many books start with something like etymologies or extracts or epithets from other authors that they want to use to kind of find the pump for the Reader in Melville does that but Melville is doing that on crack and he's really overdoing it just to keep you off balance just to let you know we are not in Kansas anymore it's not gonna be a normal **Epistolary** novel.  It is going to be my version of that and so even though we're not getting newspaper articles, advertisements, legal documents, what we are getting are scripts or essays or research reports like the cytology chapter or slapstick comedy like we jumping in bed we are getting all the different kinds of texts that could be used to tell a story and they're all being used here to in fact give us a very complete picture of a story again we are vast we contain multitudes. There are many ways that we hear and understand story as it is transmitted.

### [[🎤002 Moby Full Text Ch02 The Carpet-Bag]]
- **Summary:** Ishmael travels toward New Bedford, stopping at the Spouter-Inn.  
- **CraftLit Commentary:** The description of the inn is gothic, foreshadowing the collision of faith and madness later in the book. The “portentous, black mass” painting is an abstract microcosm of the novel itself.  
- **Themes:** Thresholds, premonition, and the unknown.

---

### [[🎤003 Moby Full Text Ch03 The Spouter-Inn]]
- **Summary:** Ishmael meets Queequeg, the tattooed harpooneer. Their first night together, comic and intimate, becomes an early parable of human connection.  
- **CraftLit Commentary:** The homoerotic undercurrent is balanced by comedy and tenderness. Melville uses the absurd to reach empathy — a pattern recurring throughout.  
- **Themes:** Brotherhood, otherness, and the breaking of social boundaries.  
- **Audio Note:** Subtle tavern sounds; playful bass line during their awkward introduction.

---

### [[🎤004 Moby Full Text Ch04 The Counterpane]] — [[🎤005 Moby Full Text Ch05 Breakfast]] — [[🎤006 Moby Full Text Ch06 The Street]]
- **Summary:** Domestic scenes contrast the earlier mystery. Queequeg’s rituals are treated with respect.  
- **CraftLit Commentary:** Ishmael’s curiosity dissolves prejudice; Melville makes radical empathy humorous and holy at once.  
- **Themes:** Cross-cultural friendship, equality, daily ritual as sacred.  
- **Note:** Tie to CraftLit’s *“repair as self-care”* motif — spiritual mending mirrored in physical craft.

---

### [[🎤009 Moby Full Text Ch09 The Sermon]]
- **Summary:** Father Mapple preaches Jonah’s story from a ship-shaped pulpit.  
- **CraftLit Commentary:** “Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low?” appears here — a reminder of moral proportionality and humility before the divine.  
- **Themes:** Repentance, moral proportion, humility, and the necessity of doubt.  
- **Audio Note:** Add subtle church reverb; underscore sermon with quiet creak of timbers and wind.  
- **Cross-Link:** Central to the *Doubt* thematic cluster.

---

### [[🎤016 Moby Full Text Ch16 The Ship]] — [[🎤017 Moby Full Text Ch17 The Prophet]] — [[🎤018 Moby Full Text Ch18 The Bosom Friend]]
- **Summary:** Ishmael and Queequeg sign aboard the *Pequod*. Elijah’s warning injects foreboding.  
- **CraftLit Commentary:** The *Pequod* as microcosm of America: racially diverse crew, capitalist enterprise, moral risk.  
- **Themes:** Fate, forewarning, free will, industrial ambition.  
- **Sound Design:** Short wood-creak motif echoing doom; underscores Elijah’s prophecy.

---

### [[🎤028 Moby Full Text Ch28 Ahab]] — [[🎤029 Moby Full Text Ch29 Enter Ahab]] — [[🎤030 Moby Full Text Ch30 Sunset]] — [[🎤031 Moby Full Text Ch31 The Quarter-Deck]]
- **Summary:** Ahab appears; his monomania unfolds. The quarter-deck speech binds the crew to his will.  
- **CraftLit Commentary:** Melville’s shift from realism to Shakespearean tragic mode. Ahab’s metaphysical war against the whale = rebellion against unknowable truth.  
- **Themes:** Hubris, leadership, moral contagion, fate vs. defiance.  
- **Production Note:** Dramatic underscore; layer ocean thunder for emotional intensity.

---

### [[🎤032 Moby Full Text Ch32 Cetology]]
- **Summary:** Ishmael catalogues whales scientifically and absurdly.  
- **CraftLit Commentary:** A satire on human need for classification — an Enlightenment impulse collapsing under its own weight.  
- **Themes:** Knowledge, taxonomy, futility.  
- **Audio Idea:** Pencil scratch sounds over faint waves to mimic scholarly obsession.

---

### [[🎤040 Moby Full Text Ch40 Midnight Forecastle]]
- **Summary:** A chorus of sailors of all nations sings and jokes before sleep.  
- **CraftLit Commentary:** Democratic chorus — the sea as stage for universal humanity. Introduces Pip’s lightheartedness before his later tragedy.  
- **Themes:** Comradeship, fleeting joy, contrast between high tragedy and low comedy.  
- **Sound Notes:**  
  1. Sail sheet being raised  
  2. Yard-arm creak coming about  
  3. Happy tambourine for Pip  
  (All chosen to balance realism with buoyant tone.)

### [[🎤042 Moby Full Text Ch42 The Whiteness of the Whale]] — [[🎤093 Moby Full Text Ch93 The Castaway (Pip)]] — [[🎤132 Moby Full Text Ch132 The Symphony]] — [[🎤135 Moby Full Text Ch135 The Chase Third Day]]

## Thematic Notes

### Doubt
- *Recurring motif across CraftLit’s “Doubt Essay.”*  
  - Ishmael embodies doubt as humility; Ahab rejects it as weakness.  
  - Father Mapple’s sermon frames doubt as the threshold to repentance.  
  - CraftLit’s interpretive lens: “Doubt as moral ballast.”  
- Cross-reference: *Wonder → Humility → Empathy → Repentance → Growth* five-act schema.

### Whiteness
- Based on Chapter 42.  
  - The whiteness of the whale = purity inverted to terror.  
  - Melville’s color symbolism anticipates modern discussions of perception, race, and the sublime.  
  - Pair with CraftLit theme “seeing whiteness vs. believing in purity.”

### Whale Facts
- Ishmael’s digressions serve as proto-documentary essays.  
- Function: Ground myth in sensory, factual detail while undermining certainty.  
- Tie-in: CraftLit annotation layer — aligning with Power Moby-Dick references and external links.

### Brotherhood and Equality
- Ishmael + Queequeg as archetype of interdependence.  
- Early vision of globalism and moral fellowship amid chaos.  
- Connect to CraftLit’s thread on *repair and empathy through craft.*

### Madness and Monomania
- Ahab as prototype of the obsessive leader — echoing political, industrial, and religious absolutism.  
- His “pasteboard mask” speech = struggle to see through surface to truth.  
- Doubt rejected = tragedy inevitable.

## Literary and Contextual Commentary

- **Style:** Melville fuses epic, sermon, stage play, and encyclopedia — a “hypertext before hypertext.”  
- **Voice:** Ishmael’s changing register mirrors the motion of the sea: calm → storm → stillness.  
- **Influences:** Shakespeare, Milton, Emerson, and 19th-century whaling narratives (*Two Years Before the Mast*).  
- **Context:** Written during the height of American whaling industry; spiritual crisis of the mid-19th century.  
- **CraftLit Analytic Lens:** Reading aloud restores Melville’s rhythm — syntax as wave motion.
