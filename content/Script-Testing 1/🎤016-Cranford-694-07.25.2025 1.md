## B-Block-08:15  - 12:00 BOOK TALK—Re-hash Notes
Chapter 15--Peter is Back - and that means there's a MAN IN TOWN! Gonna shake things up!

## Pre-hash Notes
- REMEMBER - Mary Smith's narrative spans many years and criss crosses all over. At this point it's been at least 12 or 13 years since Miss Jessie married. (!) 
- search eText for 
	- Mr Mulliner is Mrs Jamison's unpleasant butler
	- Father of the Faithful - Abraham (Jewish and Muslim progenitor)
	- Simon Jones (181)- not mentioned before, tho there was a THOMAS Jones who escorted the ladies during the crime wave;  
	- Arley (182) - of Arley Hall, and Miss Pole defends Miss Matty when it looks like they're getting blocked from Lady Glenmire with: "You are the daughter of a rector, at any rate, and related to the Arleys; and Sir Peter might have been Viscount Arley, every one says.”  - *Arley's are mentioned in this chapter in a memory of Peter's - back with there were more well-to-do folks in town (much like Emma);* 
	- Flora (The Gordon's daughter/Jessie's daughter) and 
	- Mr Ludovic NO IDEA(186) 
- 16:00 - Edward Said (Palestinian American, 1935-2003) book *Orientalism* in 1978 was news, now it's just "well, duh". ==get bookshop.org/farley's link to that book==
![[Pasted image 20250720095418.jpg]]
- 24:48 - Negus (182) - hot port, sugar, lemon, spices [Negus recipe](https://britishfoodhistory.com/2023/12/24/negus/) and if you search there are MANY variations. (Mrs Beeton had something to say about the recipe - FOR KIDS!--[not these Beetons](https://knitty.com/ISSUEwinter05/PATTmrsbeeton.html))

- 27:00 Preston Guild (1179) has held fair in Lancashire town every 20 years since 1542. Last in 2012, next in 2032 (only ***ever*** postponed in 1942) ![[Pasted image 20250720094018.png]]
- wonderful = FULL OF WONDER
- Propitiating - win or regain favor (of a god or person) by doing something they like
- Dissenters - religious dissenters were worse than "heathens" for some folks - some day I've got to get a Dissenter expert on here...
- Peter will do something that might really tick you off - it sure did me - but I think he makes up for it (mostly) at the end of the chapter.

## C-30:33 Block Book Audio / D-51:23 - Block-Post-chapter Notes

## 58:33 The Last Generation in England

## 1:23:56 The Cage at Cranford

Going to play them out with the Last Generation in England
- If PETER does it, it must be VERY cool - even sitting criss-cross-applesauce on the FLOOR!
- Major Gordon apparently knows Mrs. Hoggins' (neé Lady Glenmire's) previous Husband?!
- Loved that our ladies were a bit scandalized at first that Betty Barker had been invited to the luncheon by Miss Jessie, previously maid to Mrs Jamieson - but Miss Pole points out that the Captain did weird things like that (disregard of the genteel proprieties of life), but Mrs Jamieson was happy b/c it put The Hoggins' (i.e., Lady G) on the same level as a former maid. HA!
- At first it looked like PETER Paid for Signor Brunoni, but NO - Mrs. Jamieson - but he's as crafty as the ladies! "Don't be shocked at all my wonderful stories, I consider Mrs. Jamieson fair game, and besides, I'm bent on propitiating [regaining her favor] her, and the first steps towards it are keeping her well awake. I bribed her here by asking her to let me have her name as patron is for my poor conjure this evening, and I don't want to give her time enough to get up her rancor against the Huggins is, who are just coming in. I want everybody to be friends. I bribed her here by asking her to let me have her name as patroness for my poor conjurer this evening, and I don't want to give her time enough to get up her rancor against the Hoggins', who are just coming in. I want everybody to be friends, for it harasses Matty, so much to hear of those quarrels. I shall go at it again by-and-by, so you need not look shocked. I intend to enter the assembly rooms tonight with Mrs. Jamison on one side and my Lady, Mrs. Hoggins on the other. You see if I don't." - ==I think that makes up for him being a bone head about Mr Holbrook.==
