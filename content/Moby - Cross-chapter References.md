- - found a [very detailed 3-D model of a 19th Century Explorer's sailing ship](https://youtu.be/3pYqXrFx6S8?si=AwlWw1X2gpYwuNuh). It includes exterior, and around 7min it starts showing the interior (including a mispronunciation of fo'c'sle 🤷‍♀️). (Here's the same for an [18th C. Warship](https://youtu.be/3pYqXrFx6S8?si=Ynfy7jdWjbTYbPdq), if you're interested—he's got a lot of cool explainer videos on his channel!)
