## CHAPTER 32. Cetology. (sec. 1)

Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the Pequod‚Äôs weedy[^1] hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.

It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,[^2] that I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here essayed.[^3] Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.

‚ÄúNo branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology,‚Äù says [Captain Scoresby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Scoresby),[^4] A.D. 1820.

‚ÄúIt is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. * * * Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal‚Äù (sperm whale), says [Surgeon Beale](https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryof00beal/page/n9/mode/1up), A.D. 1839.

‚ÄúUnfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.‚Äù ‚ÄúImpenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.‚Äù ‚ÄúA field strewn with thorns.‚Äù ‚ÄúAll these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.‚Äù

Thus speak of the whale, the great [Cuvier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Cuvier), and [John Hunter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hunter_%28surgeon%29), and [Lesson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rene_Lesson),[^5] those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:‚ÄîThe Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny;[^6] [Aldrovandi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulisse_Aldrovandi); [Sir Thomas Browne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Browne); [Gesner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Gessner);[^7] [Ray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ray); [Linn√¶us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaeus); [Rondeletius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rondeletius);[^8] [Willoughby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Willughby);[^9] [Green](https://archive.org/details/b30414283_0001);[^10] [Artedi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artedi); [Sibbald](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sibbald); [Brisson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathurin_Jacques_Brisson);[^11] [Marten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friderich_Martens); [Lac√©p√®de](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Germain_%C3%89tienne_de_la_Ville,_Comte_de_Lac%C3%A9p%C3%A8de); [Bonneterre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Joseph_Bonnaterre); [Desmarest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselme_Ga%C3%ABtan_Desmarest);[^12] [Baron Cuvier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Cuvier); [Frederick Cuvier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Cuvier); [John Hunter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hunter_%28surgeon%29); [Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen);[^13] [Scoresby](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/69504); Beale; [Bennett](https://archive.org/details/narrativeofwhali02bennrich); [J. Ross Browne](http://www.famousamericans.net/johnrossbrowne/); the [Author of Miriam Coffin](https://archive.org/details/miriamcoffinorwh00hart); [Olmstead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Allyn_Olmsted); and the [Rev. T. Cheever](https://www.bartleby.com/library/bios/1251.html).[^14] But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will show.

Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following [Owen](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/bluewhale/hall/whales-on-display/#:~:text=Whales%20have%20always%20shaped%20plans,Privacy%20Policy%20Terms%20&%20Conditions%20Close) ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the Greenland or ***[right-whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_whale)***, ![[Pasted image 20250819093200.png]]he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great [***sperm whale***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale), ![[Pasted image 20250819092932.png]]
compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. *And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.*[^15] He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back,[^16] invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new proclamation. This is [Charing Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charing_Cross);[^17] hear ye! good people all,‚Äîthe Greenland whale is deposed,‚Äîthe great sperm whale now reigneth!

There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale‚Äôs and [Bennett‚Äôs](https://archive.org/details/b33281038_0001); both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.

Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or‚Äîin this place at least‚Äîto much of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught[^18] of a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.

But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to have one‚Äôs hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job[^19] might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.

**First:** The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule[^20] attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linn√¶us declares, ‚ÄúI hereby separate the whales from the fish.‚Äù But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives[^21] and herring, against Linn√¶us‚Äôs express edict, were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.

The grounds upon which Linn√¶us would fain have banished the whales from the waters, he states as follows: ‚ÄúOn account of their warm bilocular heart,[^22] their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,[^23]‚Äù and finally, ‚Äúex lege natur√¶ jure meritoque.‚Äù[^24] I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.

Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linn√¶us has given you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.

Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is¬†_a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.

By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.[^25] Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.[^26]
